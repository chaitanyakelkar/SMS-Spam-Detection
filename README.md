# SMS Spam Detection using NLTK

## 📌 Overview

### This project implements an SMS spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the NLTK library. The model is trained to classify SMS messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam) based on text analysis.

## 🛠️ Features

 1.Preprocesses SMS messages (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

 2.Extracts features using TF-IDF vectorization
 
 3.Trains a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.)

 4.Predicts whether a given SMS is spam or not

 NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

 Scikit-learn

 Pandas

 NumPy

 Matplotlib (for visualization)
