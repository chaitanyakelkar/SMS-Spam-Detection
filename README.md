SMS Spam Detection using NLTK

📌 Overview

This project implements an SMS spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the NLTK library. The model is trained to classify SMS messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam) based on text analysis.

🛠️ Features

Preprocesses SMS messages (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

Extracts features using TF-IDF vectorization

Trains a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.)

Predicts whether a given SMS is spam or not

🚀 Technologies Used
